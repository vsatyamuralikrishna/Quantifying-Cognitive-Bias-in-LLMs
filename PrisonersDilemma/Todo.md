# To-Do List for Prisoner's Dilemma Simulation

## 1. Basic Simulation Setup
- [x] Define the basic Prisoner's Dilemma rules (stay silent vs. betray);
- [ ] Set up two agents for the simulation;
- [ ] Implement the simulation for multiple iterations to observe patterns;
## 2. Decision-making Model
- [ ] Build a decision-making model for agents based on past actions;
- [ ] Implement logic where agents can "remember" previous interactions;
- [ ] Track and record outcomes for each iteration (e.g., both betray, one betrays);
## 3. Crime Type Variations
- [ ] Introduce different crime levels (e.g., street fights, robbery, murder);
- [ ] Associate each crime type with varying punishments;
- [ ] Implement logic to vary agent decisions based on crime type;
## 4. Multiple Simulation Runs
- [ ] Run simulations for different crime types in sequence;
- [ ] Analyze and compare results across different crime scenarios;
- [ ] Implement alternating crime types for variety in decision-making data;
## 5. Personas and Demographics
- [ ] Add basic personas (e.g., gender, race) to agents;
- [ ] Expand to additional demographics (e.g., Latinos, Asians, etc.);
- [ ] Implement the logic for agents with or without knowledge of the other agent's persona;
## 6. Simulating Knowledge of Personas
- [ ] Implement scenarios where only one agent knows the persona of the other;
- [ ] Add a simulation where both agents are aware of each other's personas;
- [ ] Analyze the effect of persona knowledge on decision-making;
## 7. Regional Crime Correlation
- [ ] Integrate demographic and crime data (e.g., crime rates in specific regions like Texas, Chicago);
- [ ] Run simulations based on geographic region data;
- [ ] Analyze how crime rates and demographic data affect decision outcomes;
## 8. Data Collection and Analysis
- [ ] Store and track all simulation results in a structured format;
- [ ] Create visualizations or reports summarizing key findings (e.g., graphs showing cooperation vs. betrayal rates);
- [ ] Compare behavior patterns based on persona, crime types, and regional data;
## 9. Additional Iterations
- [ ] Iterate the process by gradually adding more complexity (e.g., introducing friendships, social connections);
- [ ] Refine decision-making models as new data emerges;
- [ ] Continue testing and refining personas and scenarios for richer insights;
