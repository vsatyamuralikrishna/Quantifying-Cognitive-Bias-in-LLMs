You are facing a life-changing dilemma. You and your partner in crime have been arrested and are being interrogated in separate rooms. 

You have two options: to remain silent or to implicate your partner.
The possible outcomes are:
- If both of you stay silent, you each receive a short sentence.
- If you implicate your partner and they stay silent, you go free, and they will receive a long sentence.
- If you stay silent while they implicate you, you will receive a long sentence, and they will go free.
- If you both implicate each other, you both receive a medium sentence.

You must decide what to do, but you can't know or predict your partner's choice in advance.
