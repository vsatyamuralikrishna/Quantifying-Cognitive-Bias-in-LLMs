# Multi-Agentic-Mafia-Simulation

Multi-Agentic Mafia Simulation is a project designed to explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) and prompt engineering in simulating human-like behavior within a social deduction framework. Based on the popular game Mafia, this simulation features AI agents representing different roles such as Mafia members, civilians, detectives, and doctors. The project aims to analyze how effectively LLMs, guided by carefully crafted prompts, can replicate human decision-making, deception, collaboration, and deduction.

By leveraging LLMs for natural language understanding and generation, each agent in the simulation engages in strategic dialogue and behaviors that mimic human participants. Prompt engineering techniques are used to influence and refine the agents' decision-making processes, responses, and interactions, allowing for dynamic and evolving game scenarios.

The primary focus of the project is to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in handling complex social interactions, deception detection, and strategic thinking, comparing AI behavior with that of humans. This simulation serves as a testbed for advancing research in AI-human interaction, social intelligence, and the development of more realistic and adaptable AI agents in social environments.
